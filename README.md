# Venus OS Library for creating DBUS devices


Tired of always repeating the same boilerplate for PV Inverters,
Temperature sensors and other devices on Victron Venus OS?

This library creates boilerplate classes to be used for your
own devices. The usage is pretty simple.

## Examples

- http://github.com/trixing/venus.dbus-opendtu-http
- http://github.com/trixing/venus.dbus-kaco-http

## Installation

Just clone the repository. The expectation is that it sits on
the same level as the application code. There are no fancy
installation and packaging methods provided. Keep it simple.


```
cd /data/
git clone http://github.com/trixing/venus.dbus-trixing-lib
```
